        <p>Control whether a request for a TFTP Server Address will be sent by the DHCP Client to the DHCP Server in the DHCP Request. When requested, the DHCP Server will return the TFTP Server Address to the device in the DHCP Acknowledgment.</p>

<p>The TFTP Server Address DHCP Option (Option 150) is basically a Cisco-proprietary version of the standard TFTP Server Name DHCP Option (Option Number 150).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The DHCP Client does not automatically use the TFTP Server Address to perform any file transfers or configuration. To configure a device using TFTP, the TFTP Server Address would need to be acquired using the DhcpOptionMgr and then provided to a TFTP Client that could perform the transfer of one or more files and then perform any desired configuration using those files.</p>
