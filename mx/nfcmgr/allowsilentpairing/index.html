        <p>Controls whether the device will be permitted to pair with remote Bluetooth devices without requiring user confirmation. This feature is not the same as auto-pairing; it simply removes the confirmation step after device pairing has been initiated by the device user. The settings of this parameter do not effect existing device pairings.</p>
